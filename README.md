# Blockchain Decentralized Applications
This is a repo dedicated to exploring the different aspects of the decentralized world, one layer of complexity at a time.

## 1. Smart Contract Examples

Main focus in on implementing building blocks of Solidity to create a ballot smart contract


## 2. Inbox Simple Messaging System on Rinkeby Testnet

Simple messaging system designed towards the application of testnet driven apps

## 3. Simple Lottery DAPP with React Front End

Simple lottery system in which each player can enter into the lottery with a any amount of ether and this ether will pooled into the contract. Once the contract owner decides it is time to pick a winner, that will receive the total pooled amount, a pseudo-random function is called to select the winner.

## 4. Decentralized Kickstarter with React.js, and Next.js

### Styling Framework: Boostrap Semantic UI

Each user can create new campaigns (anyone can, then they become the owner of that campaign), anyone can contribute to a decentralized Kickstarter campaign with Ether Rinkeby and the owner of the campaign can send payment requests (like you guys donated X amount towards the campaign, I need Y amount to pay for this this and this with recipient account address made public) and the people who donated can vote yes or no to that request, if it satisfies a minimum approval rate of 50%, then the owner of the campaign can finalize the payment request

## 5. Simple Decentralized eCommerce Application with React.js, web3.js, and Truffle Framework

### Styling Framework: Basic Boostrap

Simple application with minimal UI designed to test the buying and selling capabilities of accounts deployed on a blockchain. A user can create a product and list it for sale, and a seller can buy said product. Buyers cannot be sellers, i.e. an item cannot be bought twice buy the buyer. This has been deployed on the Mumbai Matic TestNet and is available at: https://dapp-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/
