# Decentralized Applications

-----------------------


## 1. Inbox Simple Messaging System on Rinkeby Testnet

Simple messaging system designed towards the application of testnet driven apps

## 2. Simple Lottery DAPP with React Front End

Simple lottery system in which each player can enter into the lottery with a any amount of ether and this ether will pooled into the contract. Once the contract owner decides it is time to pick a winner, that will receive the total pooled amount, a pseudo-random function is called to select the winner.

## 3. Decentralized Kickstarter with React.js and Next.js

### Styling Framework: Boostrap Semantic UI

Each user can create new campaigns (anyone can, then they become the owner of that campaign), anyone can contribute to a decentralized Kickstarter campaign with Ether Rinkeby and the owner of the campaign can send payment requests (like you guys donated X amount towards the campaign, I need Y amount to pay for this this and this with recipient account address made public) and the people who donated can vote yes or no to that request, if it satisfies a minimum approval rate of 50%, then the owner of the campaign can finalize the payment request

## 4. Simple Decentralized eCommerce Application with React.js, web3.js, and Truffle Framework

### Styling Framework: Basic Boostrap

Simple application with minimal UI designed to test the buying and selling capabilities of accounts deployed on a blockchain. A user can create a product and list it for sale, and a seller can buy said product. Buyers cannot be sellers, i.e. an item cannot be bought twice buy the buyer. This has been deployed on the Mumbai Matic TestNet and is available at: https://dapp-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/

**N.B.** This DApp only works if your metamask is connected to the Mumbai Matic Testnet

## 5. Yield Staking DApp

Simple yield farming DApp where a user can stake and unstake their mock Tether (USDT) and the deployer of the DApp is able to issue the Reward tokens from the command line in Truffle. This is an oversimplified version of real-world staking, and is used to demonstrate the core mechanics of an escrow account that receives and sends tokens.

## 6. Forward Rate Agreement using MakerDAO

Forward rate agreements (FRA) are over-the-counter contracts between parties that determine the rate of interest to be paid on an agreed-upon date in the future. In other words, an FRA is an agreement to exchange an interest rate commitment on a notional amount.

In the decentralized space we will use MakerDAO's DAI as the notional amount's currency, and use the MakerDAO stability rate rather than the traditional LIBOR or Fed Funds rate reference rates.
