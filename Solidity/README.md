# Introduction to Solidity Programming

This is intended as a comprehensive guide towards learning the Solidity Programming Language.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Strings

Strings in Solidity and in Blockchain are computationally expensive, therefore, we first store them in memory, similar to RAM, i.e. a temporary memory block, and then in order to make any computation on the strings we need to convert them into `bytes` first.

### 2. OOP in Solidity

Solidity is an Object-Oriented Language that replaces the keywork **Class** with the keyword **Contract**. Here we will learn about the four pillars of OOP applied to Solidity:

a. Encapsulation

b. Abstraction

c. Inheritance

d. Polymorphism

### 3. Arrays

Creating arrays in Solidity is similar to other programming languages with the exception of deleting an element based on a pre-defined index. We will look at a workaround to this problem, as well as introduce the main methods used in arrays and how to initialise them in Solidity.
