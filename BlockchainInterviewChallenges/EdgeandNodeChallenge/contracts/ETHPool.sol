/**
 * Requirements:
 *
 * - Only the team can deposit rewards.
 * - The team can deposit rewards at any time.
 * - Deposited rewards go to the pool of users, not to individual users.
 * - Users should be able to withdraw their deposits along with their share
 *   of rewards considering the time when they deposited. They should not get
 *   rewards for the ones distributed before their deposits.
